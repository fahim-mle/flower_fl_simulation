- **In Progress:** Week 4 (10% progress on Week 4 tasks)
- **Not Started:** Weeks 5-10 (60% of project)

### Task Statistics
- **Total Estimated Tasks:** ~80 tasks
- **Completed Tasks:** ~12 tasks (15%)
- **In Progress:** 1 branch created, 0 tasks completed
- **Remaining Tasks:** ~68 tasks (85%)

### Estimated Branches
- **Total Branches:** 33 branches

- **Remaining:** 32 branches

### Critical Path
```
Week 4 (mTLS) ‚Üí Week 5 (VPN) ‚Üí Week 6 (Keycloak) ‚Üí Week 7 (Scaling) ‚Üí Week 8 (Security Eval) ‚Üí Week 9 (Docs) ‚Üí Week 10 (Finalize)
```

**Current Blocker:** Need to complete Certificate Authority setup before proceeding with mTLS implementation.

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Week 4 Foundation
1. Create `feature/setup-certificate-authority` branch
2. Install EasyRSA and set up PKI
3. Generate CA certificate
4. Generate server certificates for SuperLink
5. Generate client certificates for SuperNodes

### Priority 2: Implement mTLS (Current Branch)
6. Update server_app.py with SSL context
7. Update client_app.py with SSL context
8. Reconfigure Docker containers with certificates
9. Test mTLS connectivity
10. Document the process

### Priority 3: Project Structure
11. Create missing directories (certificates/, scripts/, docs/, configs/)
12. Create automation scripts for certificate generation
13. Start documentation in docs/ directory

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Certificate Management:** Complex setup, easy to misconfigure
- **Timeline:** 60% of project remaining, aggressive schedule
- **Integration:** Multiple security layers (mTLS + VPN + Keycloak) must work together

### Medium Risk
- **VPN Configuration:** Network routing can be challenging
- **Performance:** Security overhead may impact FL performance
- **Keycloak:** OIDC integration with Flower may require custom work

### Low Risk
- **Docker Infrastructure:** Already working well
- **Flower Framework:** Well-documented, stable
- **Monitoring:** Standard tools (Grafana/Prometheus)

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16
**Current Branch:** `feature/enable-tls-superlink-supernodes`
**Next Milestone:** Week 4 - mTLS Implementation
