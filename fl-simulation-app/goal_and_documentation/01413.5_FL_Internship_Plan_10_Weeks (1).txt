01413.4_Project_Plan – Evaluating
Federated Learning Infrastructures and
Security Mechanisms
Team: QCIF Applied AI and Quantum Algorithms | Secure Federated Learning Team

Project Duration: 2025-09-30 to 2025-12-06 (10 weeks, ~10 hours per week)


1. Introduction
The project focuses on evaluating the Flower Federated Learning (FL) framework within the
National Infrastructure for Secure Federated Learning (NINA).
The intern will set up a local test environment, run sample federated learning workflows, and
evaluate security and operational mechanisms such as VPN connections, mTLS certificates, and
role-based authentication (Keycloak).

The goal is to provide insights into infrastructure readiness and security risks when scaling to
multiple organisations and sensitive health datasets.


2. Project Justification
Secure federated learning allows machine learning models to be trained on sensitive medical
data without transferring the data outside institutional boundaries.
QCIF is deploying a production-grade FL environment, and this internship will:
- Validate deployment steps and documentation.
- Identify risks in security and operational procedures.
- Provide reproducible local setup instructions for development and testing.


3. Objectives
- Install and configure a local Flower federated learning environment (server + clients).
- Run initial federated learning experiments using synthetic datasets.
- Test VPN, certificate management, and authentication mechanisms.
- Identify performance and security bottlenecks.
- Recommend improvements for deployment workflows and documentation.


4. Deliverables
- Working local Flower test setup with documentation.
- Scripts and configuration files for automated setup.
- Report on security evaluation (VPN, certificates, Keycloak).
- Recommendations for production deployment improvements.
- Final presentation and handover to QCIF team.

9. Risks and Considerations
- VPN connectivity issues may block multi-node testing.
- Certificate misconfigurations causing failed connections.
- Limited hours (10 hrs/week) may restrict advanced testing.
10. Success Measures
- Fully functional local Flower test environment with server and multiple clients.
- Documented procedures for VPN, certificates, and authentication setup.
- Clear recommendations for production rollout.
- Final report and presentation accepted by QCIF.
